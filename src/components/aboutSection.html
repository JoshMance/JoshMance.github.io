                    I've always been curious about how things fit together, and I love working with others to build systems that solve real-world problems.

                    <!-- and participated in team-based competitive programming.  -->
                    I recently completed my BSc in Computer Science and Data Science from UWA. 
                    In my final year, I helped led a team to developed software for geoarchaeologists working in Esperance WA, delivering a solution that helped streamline their sample analysis process.
                    Additionaly, also I volunteered with Coders for Causes, helping realise a project that made a tangible social impact. <br> <br> 
                    Outside of my studies, I've honed my communication and leadership skills as both a tech department team-member at Officeworks and senior tutor at NumberWorks'nWords. These experiences have taught me the value of collaboration, effective problem-solving, and delivering results under pressure. <br> <br>
                    Now, I'm focused on turning complex ideas into robust, effective solutions as an aspiring software engineer.
