                    I thrive on understanding how systems work â€” whether it's how data travels through a network or how algorithms solve complex problems. <br> <br>
                    I recently completed my BSc in Computer Science and Data Science from The University of Western Australia.
                    Along the way, I got involved in team-based competitive programming, volunteered with Coders for Causes and, in my final year, helped lead a team to create analysis software for Geoarchaeologists working in Esperance, WA. <br> <br>
                    Outside of my studies, I've honed my communication and leadership skills in customer service at Officeworks and as a senior tutor at NumberWorks'nWords. These experiences have taught me the value of collaboration, effective problem-solving, and delivering results under pressure. <br> <br>
                    Now, I'm focused on turning complex ideas into simple, effective solutions as an aspiring data engineer with proficiency in frontend web development.
