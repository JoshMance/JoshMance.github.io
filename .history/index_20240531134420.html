              <p>
                I'm a recent Computer Science and Data Science graduate from the University of Western Australia, with a deep love for technology and coding. My technical training  includes Python, SQL, C, JavaScript, and VBA. I thrive on web development, creating dynamic and responsive web applications, and solving complex problems with algorithmic thinking.
              </p> 
                <p>I'm passionate about data visualization, high-performance computing, and applied mathematics. 
                Throughout my studies, I've worked on projects that turn data into compelling stories and explored the potential of high-performance systems. I enjoy designing and optimizing databases, and implementing robust algorithms to drive innovative solutions. </p>
              <p> 
                Beyond my academic pursuits, I have five years of experience as a maths tutor, where I've developed strong mentoring skills and a solid foundation in math and science education. Recently, I've worked in the tech side of Officeworks, which allowed me to enhance my interpersonal skills and gain valuable insights into business operations and technology integration. </p>
              </p> 

              <p> 
                I'm excited to continue growing in the tech world, leveraging my diverse experiences, and sharing my knowledge with the community. Whether it's building innovative web apps, optimizing databases, or helping students achieve their academic goals, I'm all in.</p>
